Facial Emotion Detection
This repository contains a Python-based project for facial emotion detection using Google Colab. It utilizes machine learning techniques and computer vision to recognize and classify facial emotions from images or video feeds.

Features
Facial Emotion Classification: Detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.
Pre-trained Models: Utilizes pre-trained models like OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for facial detection and emotion recognition.
Google Colab Integration: Provides a Google Colab notebook for easy access and experimentation.
Custom Training Option: Option to train your model using custom datasets for specific use cases.
Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Google Colab (web-based)
Required Python libraries:
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
These can be installed using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/facial-emotion-detection.git
cd facial-emotion-detection
Open the Google Colab notebook (Facial_Emotion_Detection.ipynb) in your browser.

Upload the required datasets (if training your own model).

Install the necessary libraries in the Colab environment by running the setup cell.

How to Use
Run Pre-trained Model:

Load the provided pre-trained model in the Colab notebook.
Upload an image or use the live webcam feed (if supported).
The model will classify the detected emotion.
Train Custom Model:

Place your dataset in the datasets directory.
Update the dataset path in the Colab notebook.
Run the training cells to build and train the model.
Save and export the trained model.
Datasets
Default Dataset: The project uses the FER-2013 dataset by default.
Custom Datasets: Users can add their own dataset in .csv or image folder format.
Results
The model achieves an average accuracy of XX% on the validation dataset. Detailed results and confusion matrix can be found in the Colab notebook output.

Future Enhancements
Add support for real-time emotion detection via live video feed.
Improve classification accuracy with advanced neural network architectures.
Include additional emotions and more robust datasets.
